      | What is Shiritori?
    p
      | Shiritori is a Japanese word game.
    br
    p
      | Each turn, a player says a word that begins with the final kana (character) of the previous word.
      | For example, if the bot says 検討 (けんとう), you must respond with a word that starts with う.
    br
    p
      | The game ends when a player gives up or says an illegal word.
      | Illegal words are ones that have already been used or ones that end in ん, as there are no words that begin with ん.
      | The bot gives up when you completely exhaust its word bank. Congratulations if you manage this!
